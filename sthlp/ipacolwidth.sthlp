{title:Description} 

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacolwidth} dynamically adjusts the widths of columns in the specified Excel sheet based on the length of the values in each column of the dataset in memory. The adjustment takes into account the number of characters, using Excel's default font style for measurement. To maintain readability and aesthetics, the width is capped at 85 characters, and an additional space of 4 characters is automatically included to enhance the presentation. Should the variable names be longer than the content, the column width will prioritize the variable name length.
